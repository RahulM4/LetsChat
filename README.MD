```javascript
// -----deployment code-----

const path = require("path");
const __dirname1 = path.resolve();
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname1, "/frontend/build")));
  app.get("*", (req, res) =>
    res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname1, "frontend", "build", "index.html"))
  );
} else {
  app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("API is running..");
  });
}

// -----deployment code ends-----
```
